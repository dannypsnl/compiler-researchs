# PLT research

This repository contains several PLT related sub-projects that I created for learning these certain subjects.

### Tools Installation

To support math fomula, I use scribble and scribble-math, so install Racket and scribble-math was required,
we could use following commands and documents to get them.

- [Racket Installation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/Installation.html)

```sh
# notice that raco was provided by Racket
raco pkg install --deps search-auto scribble-math pie
```
